How to install a new instance of e-venement v2 ?

== Prerequisites ==

For the moment just take your time, keep things step by step, know that it's a symfony-based app...
And take it easy, relax, have a beer, a coke, a cigarette... and why not a cofee ?


== PHP & Symfony ==

1. install PHP5 (cli + apache2) and the required module for your environment (databases, etc.)
2. install Symfony the way you prefer
3. test if Symfony has got all it needs


== e-venement ==

1. checkout the subversion repository : svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/e-venement/trunk
2. transform all the tamplated files into files that fits your needs : find -iname '*.template'
3. verify that your log/ and cache/ directories are read/writable by the web server
4. create a first user : ./symfony help guard:create-user
5. promote this first user to "super-admin" : ./symfony guard:promote [xxxx]
6. import pre-defined permissions and groups : ./symfony doctrine:data-load --append data/fixtures/10-permissions.yml
7. (optional) add french postalcodes for autocompletion (it takes lots of time and memory) : ./symfony doctrine:data-load --append data/fixture/20-postalcodes.yml
8. read the user documentation
9. start funny things with e-venement...
