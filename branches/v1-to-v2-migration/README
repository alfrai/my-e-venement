== What it does ==

this script migrates (from a postgresql DB to an other postgresql one) :

- contacts
- organisms
- professionals
- phonenumbers
- groups
- users (see next chapter for more details)

== What it does not ==

this script cannot migrate all data, this is where are its limits :

- it doesn't migrate users' passwords
- it doesn't migrate users' rights
- it doesn't support duplicated accounts and expired account (by date)
- it migrates all data from groups, even contacts or professionals who are not "included", don't forget to delete them before

== How does it work ? ==

copy config.php.template into config.php and set it up.
then run "php all.php"

eventually you can run the script model by model like that (looking into all.php) :
php all.php contact
php all.php organism_category
php all.php organism
...
